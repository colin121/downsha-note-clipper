# downsha-note-clipper
This is an implementation of web page clipper for PKM (Personal Knowledge Management). Like Evernote clipper, It runs as a browser plugin (Chrome Extension or Firefox Add-on). We mainly  use HTML5 and Javascript to implement the core routines, including main body recognition, web page clipping, web page uploading, etc.
